# Introduction
This project focuses on the implementation of numerical algorithms for solving systems of equations in the form of $$Ax=b$$
The primary objective is to provide a code-base for users to practice and develop their understanding of the fundamentals of numerical multi-linear algebra, an essential field in mathematics and engineering. The program utilizes prebuilt commands to simplify the process while still presenting a challenge to users to create simple solutions to complex problems. With further development time, the software has the potential to solve more intricate equations. This project invites enthusiasts to contribute or improve the code, especially with the user-interface side of the project.

The are 3 main stages in total:
1. Assigning values to matrix $A$ and vector $b$
2. Selecting one of the available algorithms, which are:
    1. [Singular Value Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition)
    2. [QR Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition)
    3. [LU Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition)
3. Outputting the results

This program is written in `Python 3`, and requires 3 libraries to be installed beforehand:
1. [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
2. [Scipy](https://scipy.org/)
3. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
